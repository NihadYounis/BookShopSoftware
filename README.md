# BookShop
BookShopSoftware :In this Project We created a VB.NET complete application of Book Shop Management. The Application starts with a nice looking splash form which leads to a login form. The login form will be connected to the database , if the user id and password match the database, the user will login to the main form. The Application has two Roles: Admin and User The Admin can Save, Edit and Delete Users and Books. The User can Sell Books and Print Bills.
